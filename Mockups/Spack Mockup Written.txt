Overall Look and Feel of Spack
==============================

The overall look and feel should be a good balance between pictures and words.
We will avoid  3D buttons, but when you hover the button over it, it should light up or make the colour a lighter shade.
The website should have a "simple straight forward" feel, and
the user should feel confident in knowing what our product is.


Colours
========
For Spack, the colour of brown shows to our users how our product helps them
be strong, and has a nature-like feeling. The colour blue empthasizes how our
website has a calm and fresh feeling. It also may make our users curious about
what exactly our product is, which is what we need.

Iconography
==========
We will focus on using icons that have a flat design,
to support the feel our website is supposed to give to the user
which is a sense of calmness, as 3-D icons may confuse our users.

Typography
==========
Impacta - slogan and title
Comfortaa - rest of the website

We are using these fonts because it adds to our website's feeling of calmness
as Comfortaa is a very simple font. Impacta is a more stronger font as it is more bold.
This is important because it grabs the customer's attention to our product's name and
slogan, hopefully making them remember it.

Links
======
Links will not be underlined and the colour changes shade of colour.

Buttons
=======
Buttons will be flat designed using the colours above.
